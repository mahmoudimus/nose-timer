nose-timer
==========

A timer plugin for nosetests that answers the question: *how much time does every test takes?*

Install
-------

.. code::

   pip install nose-timer


Usage
-----

Run nosetests with the ``--with-timer`` flag, and you will see a list of the
tests and the time spent by each one (in seconds):

.. code:: bash

   myapp.tests.ABigTestCase.test_the_world_is_running: 56.0010s
   myapp.tests.ABigTestCase.test_the_rest_of_the_galaxy_is_running: 2356.0010s


How do I show only the ``n`` slowest tests?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For example, to show only the **10** slowest tests, run nosetests with
``--timer-top-n`` flag.

.. code:: bash

   nosetests --with-timer --timer-top-n 10


How do I color the output and have pretty colors?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can highlight slower tests using ``--timer-ok`` and ``--timer-warning`` flags.

- Tests which takes less time than ``--timer-ok`` will be highlighted green.
- Tests which takes less time than ``--timer-warning`` will be highlighted yellow.
- All other tests will be highlighted red.


How do I increase timer verbosity?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default nose-timer outputs test times at the end of all tests.
You can output test times after each test with ``--timer-verbose`` flag.
Note that ``--vv`` should be enabled as well to view info logs.

.. code:: bash

    nosetests --with-timer --timer-verbose -vv .
