Install
-------

To install the latest release from PyPI::

    pip install nose-timer

Or to install the latest development version from Git::

    pip install git+git://github.com/mahmoudimus/nose-timer.git

Or to install the latest from source::

    git clone https://github.com/mahmoudimus/nose-timer.git
    cd nose-timer
    pip install .

You can also make a developer install if you plan on modifying the
source frequently::

    pip install -e .



Usage
-----

Run nosetests with the ``--with-timer`` flag, and you will see a list of the
tests and the time spent by each one (in seconds)::

    myapp.tests.ABigTestCase.test_the_world_is_running: 56.0010s
    myapp.tests.ABigTestCase.test_the_rest_of_the_galaxy_is_running: 2356.0010s


How do I show only the ``n`` slowest tests?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For example, to show only the **10** slowest tests, run nosetests with the
``--timer-top-n`` flag::

    nosetests --with-timer --timer-top-n 10


How do I color the output and have pretty colors?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can highlight slower tests using ``--timer-ok`` and ``--timer-warning`` flags.
Default time unit is the second, but you can specify it explicitly, e.g. 1s, 100ms.

- Tests which take less time than ``--timer-ok`` will be highlighted in green.
- Tests which take less time than ``--timer-warning`` will be highlighted in yellow.
- All other tests will be highlighted in red.


How do I turn off pretty colors?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In some cases, you may want to disable colors completely. This is done by using the
``--timer-no-color`` flag. This is useful when running tests in a headless console.


How do I filter results by colors?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is possible to filter results by color. To do so, you can use the
``--timer-filter`` flag::

    nosetests --with-timer --timer-filter ok
    nosetests --with-timer --timer-filter warning
    nosetests --with-timer --timer-filter error


Or to apply several filters at once::

    nosetests --with-timer --timer-filter warning,error

How do I export the results ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the ``--timer-json-file <myfile.json>`` flag, it will save the result
in the following format::

  {
   'tests':
    {
    '<test key 1>':
      {
        'status': 'success'|'error'|'fail,
        'time': <float in s>
      },
    '<test key 2>':
      {
        'status': 'success'|'error'|'fail,
        'time': <float in s>
      },
     ....
   }
